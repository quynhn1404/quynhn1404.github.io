# vue-website
Hey, welcome to the code my website. I'm learning Vue at the moment, so launching my website using Vue would be a great opportunity for me to ~~struggle~~ work with VueJS.
I followed [this tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/deploy-vue-app-to-github-pages-2ada48d7397e) to getting started on creating and deploying VueJS web app with GitHub Pages. The rest is just me going through VueJS' official [documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and testing it out myself!
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
